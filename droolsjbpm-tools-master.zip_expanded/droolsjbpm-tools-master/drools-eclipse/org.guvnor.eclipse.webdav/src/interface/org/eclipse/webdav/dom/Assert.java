/**
 * <code>Assert</code> is useful for for embedding runtime sanity checks
 * in code.
 * The predicate methods all test a condition and throw some
 * type of unchecked exception if the condition does not hold.
 * <p>
 * Assertion failure exceptions, like most runtime exceptions, are
 * thrown when something is misbehaving. Assertion failures are invariably
 * unspecified behavior; consequently, clients should never rely on
 * these being thrown (and certainly should not being catching them
 * specifically).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> This class/interface is part of an interim API that is still under 
 * development and expected to change significantly before reaching stability. 
 * It is being made available at this early stage to solicit feedback from pioneering 
 * adopters on the understanding that any code that uses this API will almost 
 * certainly be broken (repeatedly) as the API evolves.
